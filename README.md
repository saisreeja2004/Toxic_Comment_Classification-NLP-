# 🛡️ Toxic Comment Classification using NLP & Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to detect and classify toxic comments from Wikipedia discussions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

The system identifies six categories of toxic behavior:

- Toxic
- Severe Toxic
- Obscene
- Threat
- Insult
- Identity Hate

The project also performs sentiment analysis and provides interactive visualizations to understand comment distribution and model performance.

## 🎯 Business Objective

Online platforms receive millions of user comments every day. Manually moderating these comments is difficult and time-consuming.

This project automates toxic comment detection, enabling social media platforms, forums, and online communities to identify harmful content quickly and improve user safety.
